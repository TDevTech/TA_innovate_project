          <h5 class="card-title">Audi A1 Sportback</h5>
          <p class="card-text">The Audi A1 lineup included a three-door, a five-door Sportback, and the sporty S1 models, as well as a number of competitors in the high-end supermini segment. Nowadays, things are a little different because the second-generation Audi A1 is only available as a five-door Sportback, albeit with the somewhat rough City-carver to add some diversity.
            Does that indicate that this A1 is the one to rule them all since it has fewer direct competitors than ever!,
            The A1 was initially offered in SE, Sport, and S Line trims, but has subsequently undergone some changes and is now available in Technik, Sport, S Line, and Vorsprung. But we're not quite done yet. For the most potent engine available, there is a S Line Competition; to learn more about that, continue reading further.
            The sport includes cloth sports seats, cruise control, and rear parking sensors in addition to upgrading the wheels from 15 to 16-inch alloys. S Line adds 17-inch alloy wheels, sports suspension, slightly altered bodywork, and trim made of half leatherette and half fabric.
            The Audi A1 Sportback may be customised a lot, and certain essential features can be found in appealing bundles. The only option we'd suggest is the Plus Pack, which includes dual-zone climate control.
            privacy glass and a front armrest in the middle. Additionally, there is the Comfort and Sound Pack, which includes a Bang & Olufsen 11-speaker radio upgrade, parking sensors, and heated front seats, as well as the Technology Pack, which includes MMI Navigation Plus, Virtual Cockpit, wireless phone charging, and Audi Connect services.
            There are four turbocharged engines available; this time, all of them are gasoline-powered; no diesel versions are planned, partly because they haven't historically sold well in vehicles of this size. Additionally, S1 is not present as it once was.
            The 25 TFSI (95 hp) is the base model, followed by the 30 TFSI (116 hp), and finally the 35 TFSI (150hp). S Tronic automatic or manual transmissions are available for all engines. The 200hp 40 TFSI, which only comes in the S Line Competition specification and with a S Tronic transmission, is the top model and features red brake callipers, adaptive suspension, and 17-inch platinum grey alloy wheels with matching door mirror housings.
            There are no diesel, hybrid, or electric versions available; the power is provided by four petrol turbocharged engines. Depending on the engine you choose, you can choose from five- or six-speed manual or dual-clutch S Tronic automatic gears. A 1.0-liter three-cylinder engine with 95 or 116 horsepower (known as the 25 TFSI) starts things off (30 TFSI). With 200Nm of torque and a 0-62 mph time of 9.5 seconds, the 30 TFSI is predicted to be the best-selling vehicle (the auto is a tenth quicker). The 95hp/175Nm 25 TFSI may suit you if you're only driving around town because it has a brisk 10.8-second 0-62mph pace. Our favourite model in the lineup is the 30 TFSI with a manual transmission. Although the three-cylinder engine isn't very exciting, it still has plenty of power for both city driving and highway cruising. It also feels like it's eager and adaptable as it delivers its modest power.
            
            Entry-level 25 TFSI cars boast impressive fuel economy ratings of up to 49.6 mpg, but their 128 g/km CO2 emissions seem a bit excessive. Interestingly, the 25's more potent 30 TFSI performs marginally better with 50.4 mpg and 126 g/km when driven manually. Both were put through WLTP testing. S Tronic-equipped vehicles are less efficient, getting 45.6 and 46.3 mpg, respectively, and emitting up to 140g/km of CO2. According to Audi, the 35 TFSI can achieve up to 44.8 mpg, with CO2 emissions down to 145 g/km for models with A S Tronic transmission. The S Line Competition, which has a 40 TFSI engine, is the top of the line model and boasts up to 160g/km emissions and 39.8 mpg.
            
            reliability of the new Audi A1 model It shouldn't be a hassle, The newest Polo and Ibiza have both been around for a long without too many issues emerging, despite sharing a platform and engines with several other VW Group products. The Audi A1 efficiently meets all of your expectations for technology and design from Audi. The interior has a cutting-edge appearance and an upscale atmosphere. Without having to drive something large or expensive to maintain, it is sufficient to check off all the luxury car boxes. But rather than a more potent vehicle with a lower specification, we would choose the three-cylinder 30 TFSI with a manual transmission and some attractive options. a cosy, neatly furnished interior, and on most models, good fuel efficiency, and attractive customization possibilities. New pricing range from £20,265–£30,045 Used price range are £12,665–£32,065 used monthly price starting at £316, Fuel economy ranges from 39.8 to 53.3 mpg, 6 Miles per pound with a road tax cost of £165 and insurance groups 16 to 31.

                  <h5 class="card-title">Best alternative option</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">The foundation of the new 500 (or the new new 500, depending on how you choose to categorise the vintage 1957 model is entirely new. It is all electric, with combustion engines not even a possibility, and was created in a new Turin facility, freeing the 500 factory to continue producing models with gasoline engines for a few more years.

                    Additionally accurate is the interior, Compared to the former model's nostalgic appeal, it is more contemporary and also seems to be better constructed. In order to make the interior of the vehicle as aesthetically pleasing as possible, buttons and switches have been minimised throughout the cabin of top-end versions, which also have widescreen infotainment displays and digital dials.
                    
                    The 500 is available in numerous trim levels, all of which come with plenty of equipment including a completely digital dashboard and air conditioning, regardless of whether you choose a hard roof or a soft top. Given the size and quality of a current smartphone screen, it's not a bad idea that lower-end vehicles come with a bracket that allows your smartphone to function as an infotainment screen.
                    
                    Fiat is targeting the 500 at the hub of affordable electric cars with a starting price of less than £20,000 after the government's Plug-in Car Grant. You should keep your expectations for the Fiat 500's usefulness in check. This is a city car, not a giant vehicle, thus the trunk and back seat aren't made to hold a lot of cargo.
                    In light of this, it is very comparable in terms of interior room with vehicles like the MINI Electric and Honda e, albeit the latter does have the advantage of having four doors. Fiat has unveiled a pretty intriguing three-door model with a single back door that opens from the rear. It is not yet known whether this option will be available in the UK.
                    
                    A truly helpful feature in a small parking space is the centre console's cutaway, which enables you to move over to the other seat and escape from either door. The front seats at least have plenty of room for drivers of all shapes and sizes.
                    The Fiat 500 has 185 litres of room, which is halfway between the Honda e's 171 litres and the MINI Electric's 211 litres. A large rear door provides easy access, and the back seats may be folded flat in one quick move to make room for larger objects to be transported. However, the 500's sloped canopy restricts inside capacity, and the seats don't fold completely flat.
                    
                    Since the 500 is equipped with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, you may never need a trailing power connection again. You also get generously sized door bins and a helpful shelf underneath the infotainment screen. This shelf includes a wireless charging pad.
                    A 93 or 118-horsepower electric motor powers the front wheels of the new 500. Even though the 500 weighs more than 1,300kg, which makes it a little heavier than the average city car, keep in mind that it is a very little vehicle.
                    This indicates that it will accelerate from 0 to 62 mph in 9.0 to 9.5 seconds. Although this is a touch slower than the Honda e's 8.3 seconds and the MINI Electric's 7.3 seconds, you never feel like you're running out of juice on the road. 
                    The 93 horsepower model's range is less than 100 miles, whereas the 118 horsepower model's range is about 140 miles. Depending on where you choose to top up, public charging—which the 500 can handle at rates of up to 85kW thanks to its potent onboard electrics—will undoubtedly cost more.

                  <h5 class="card-title">Fiat 500 Electric</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">  According to Fiat, employing one of these will require a 30-minute charge from 10 to 80 percent. The 500's relatively small battery allows for faster home charging than some larger vehicles. The larger 42kWh battery can be charged in 15 hours and 15 minutes using a three-pin plug outlet or in 4 hours and 15 minutes using an 11kW from a wall socket. We may calculate the time to be roughly nine hours.
                    Simply told, the Fiat 500 won't likely have many issues with charging times. Road tax is not required for electric vehicles, which enables company car drivers to potentially save thousands of pounds.
                    
                    The normal Fiat 500 is enjoyable to drive, but it isn't particularly sporty; for that, you should choose one of the substantially modified Abarth variants. The 500 Electric has handling characteristics that definitely won't turn anyone away, and the same is true here. However, we're hoping Abarth will acquire this new model because we sense great potential in it.
                    First the positive. The 500 has an excellent grip, allowing for quick and confident cornering. It is fun to throw around narrow streets thanks to its squat posture and four wheels, and it also handles body roll effectively.
                    On uneven surfaces, it rides poorly and has a propensity to skitter on bumps and bob about uncomfortably. For experienced drivers, the steering is also over-assisted, but it is appropriately weighted for city driving.
                    
                    The electric 500 manages to separate out from the crowd despite fierce competition, particularly the incredibly likeable Honda e, because of its retro-futuristic styling (which we adore), cosy inside, and exceptionally well-resolved electric drivetrain. The 500 is a genuine long-distance EV with a maximum range that wouldn't seem out of place on a premium electric SUV costing three times as much, but it still has all the capabilities that made its petrol-powered forebears so stunning on city streets.
                    We consider the Fiat 500 to be among the best electric vehicles available, feeling more contemporary and solid than other rifles on the market and better thought out than the MINI Electric. It’s exceptionally elegant both inside and out, quick and enjoyable to drive, and spacious for a little car. Used monthly cost starts at £426. New price range from £24,435 to £31,435; used ranges from £17,060 to £28,955. The fuel efficiency of 4.3 to 4.8 miles per kWh, insurance group 15 to 18, and no road tax.
