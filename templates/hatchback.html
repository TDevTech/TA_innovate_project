          <h5 class="card-title">Audi A3 RS Sportback</h5>
          <p class="card-text">This is the all-wheel-drive sport hatchback, a super-powerful third-generation Audi RS 3. Hatch, I suppose. It is offered in the UK as a four-door RS 3 Saloon or a five-door hatchback that Audi refers to as the RS 3 Sportback. A five-cylinder, 2.5-litre engine powers the RS 3. Higher turbo boost is now possible thanks to new management software, resulting in more power and torque that are available from lower revs and that last longer at their peak. The sole available transmission is a seven-speed twin-clutch automatic. A Torque Splitter system, which replaces a traditional differential at the back axle, is new for the RS 3. The amount of torque transmitted to each rear wheel is managed by electronically controlled clutches on either side. The outside wheel typically receives greater torque, which makes the RS 3 turn more enthusiastically. In slick conditions, if the system notices the automobile starting to slide in the back, it can distribute torque to the wheel to draw the vehicle. strong and passionate sounding engine, Flexible and surprisingly cosy, superior interior price range: new: £54,655-£61,905. Between £47,345 and £61,490 for used 31.0 to 31.4 mpg in fuel economy, £520 in road taxes. 3.8 miles per pound (mpp), insurance groups 35 to 40. 

            One of the most distinctive and memorable-sounding engines on the market right now is the 2.5-liter five-cylinder. It is undoubtedly swift as well. The Audi RS 3 feels more quick and positive than some all-wheel-drive sports vehicles, and its handling balance doesn't lean toward understeer. The Torque Splitter, which keeps the RS 3 feeling upbeat and engaged at all times, is largely to blame for this. It is incredibly grippy and instils great confidence in the driver. You can keep your hands in the same position on the steering wheel during tight turns thanks to the steering's extremely quick response time without being overly touchy. The RS 3's huge turning radius, however, is worse than that of larger saloon cars, like many wide-tyred hot hatchbacks.</p>

                  <h5 class="card-title">Best alternative option</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">The Yaris Cross is an excellent vehicle. It is not only the most recent advancement in technology that has been available on the market for at than 20 years, but it is also the ideal size for most owners, in most settings, and for most uses.
                    The Yaris moniker is misleading since it portrays the vehicle as a little, urban-friendly vehicle whereas in reality it is wide, has a huge, conveniently designed trunk, an imposing stance up front that is taller than the Lexus UX, and wide-opening rear doors. The package is completed by improved ground clearance and excellent economy for a small SUV fuelled by gasoline.
                    
                    The Yaris Cross has a few gimmicks to keep it on your shopping list, such as all-wheel drive variants, but it's the total package's robustness that makes it worthwhile to take into consideration.
                    While the Yaris Cross's inside is quite close to that of its supermini namesake, the exterior bears little resemblance. Although it's durable and comfy enough, the large amount of charcoal plastic and cloth lacks any personalization to lighten the mood. It doesn't feel special. What it does feel like is well-made, with only the tiniest flaws in the door pulls and rear trim's polish. It has the air of a car constructed to a higher quality than most since it is gloriously free of squeaks and rattles.
                    This is comforting because you almost certainly paid more for it than comparable competitors. You'll enjoy it as long as you prefer substance over style.
                    
                    The accurate, yet not unduly heavy steering and a sense of solidity on the road that fits the calibre of the car's construction support this pleasing power delivery. The best part is that it can comfortably go above 50 mpg and, when the traffic is right, even approach 60 mpg without a plug-in option.
                    The Yaris Cross has just one available engine, a hybrid, making life simpler. However, you do have a selection of trims, including the Premiere Edition for the first year, Icon, Design, Excel, and Dynamic.
                    Beyond that, the only important choice is whether or not you have a clever four-wheel drive. Rather than turning the Yaris, it employs a motor for the back wheels and is designed for light off-roading and bad weather than for making the Yaris Cross a true 4x4.A 1.5-liter, three-cylinder gasoline engine and an electric motor are paired in the Yaris Cross's sole configuration. With respect to competitors, the two's combined power output of 116hp is favourable.

                  <p class="card-text"> The small Yaris can still be released from sticky circumstances even with optional AWD-i since the back motor adds torque rather than horsepower, which is roughly 6 horsepower. A 105 mph top speed and an 11.2 second 0 to 62 mph pace are also possible (11.8 for the four-wheel drive version). The three-cylinder engine quietly hums away in the background, and even though those performance stats don't indicate an exciting drive, it feels swift off the line and smooth in normal driving when travelling. It works best for city work, while it is also quiet and elegant on the freeway.
                    Toyota's found the skill of creating cars that are not only predictable and safe but also enjoyable to drive. Although it falls short of the GR Yaris' hot-hatch silliness, the Yaris Cross comes close and makes you wonder what it might be like with more power. 
                    
                    The Toyota Yaris Cross passed our rigorous road testing with flying colours. It is easy to drive, practical, roomy for passengers and luggage, and fuel-efficient. It lacks the personality and charm that the class-leading product offers. between £24,350 and £34,495 new Between £20,165 and £28,930 for used
