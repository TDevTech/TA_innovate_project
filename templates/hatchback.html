          <h5 class="card-title">Audi A3 RS 3 Sportback</h5>
          <p class="card-text">This is the all-wheel-drive sport hatchback, a super-powerful third-generation Audi RS 3. Hatch, I suppose. It is offered in the UK as a four-door RS 3 Saloon or a five-door hatchback that Audi refers to as the RS 3 Sportback. A five-cylinder, 2.5-litre engine powers the RS 3. Higher turbo boost is now possible thanks to new management software, resulting in more power and torque that are available from lower revs and that last longer at their peak. The sole available transmission is a seven-speed twin-clutch automatic. A Torque Splitter system, which replaces a traditional differential at the back axle, is new for the RS 3. The amount of torque transmitted to each rear wheel is managed by electronically controlled clutches on either side. The outside wheel typically receives greater torque, which makes the RS 3 turn more enthusiastically. In slick conditions, if the system notices the automobile starting to slide in the back, it can distribute torque to the wheel to draw the vehicle. strong and passionate sounding engine, Flexible and surprisingly cosy, superior interior price range: new: £54,655-£61,905. Between £47,345 and £61,490 for used 31.0 to 31.4 mpg in fuel economy, £520 in road taxes. 3.8 miles per pound (mpp), insurance groups 35 to 40. 

            One of the most distinctive and memorable-sounding engines on the market right now is the 2.5-liter five-cylinder. It is undoubtedly swift as well. The Audi RS 3 feels more quick and positive than some all-wheel-drive sports vehicles, and its handling balance doesn't lean toward understeer. The Torque Splitter, which keeps the RS 3 feeling upbeat and engaged at all times, is largely to blame for this. It is incredibly grippy and instils great confidence in the driver. You can keep your hands in the same position on the steering wheel during tight turns thanks to the steering's extremely quick response time without being overly touchy. The RS 3's huge turning radius, however, is worse than that of larger saloon cars, like many wide-tyred hot hatchbacks.</p>
