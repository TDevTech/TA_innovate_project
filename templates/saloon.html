          <h5 class="card-title">Mercedes-Benz S Class</h5>
          <p class="card-text"> The Mercedes-Benz S-Class has the responsibility of innovating in its field. And in the case of this one, its creator went above and above to create a vehicle that is intended to be smoother and more tranquil than ever.

            However, even if you aren't looking for a pricey luxury car, you should still pay attention to the S-Class. Over the following few years, more affordable cars will surely incorporate a large portion of the technology that debuts here.
            The Audi A8, BMW 7 Series, and other formidable competitors present the S-Class with a wide range of challenges. In order to capture your attention, the S-Class must surpass a number of competing vehicles,
            and we believe it succeeds.
            The S-Class interior has rich, soft surfaces throughout and an almost cosy wraparound feeling. While there is only one, sizable display panel that slopes downward and a prominent infotainment touchscreen that dominates the front view, technology continues to define the S-Class' ambition to forge a path others follow. It has a 12.8-inch control panel with haptic feedback and OLED technology, making it simple to read from any angle and use. The usage of augmented reality head-up displays and 3D instruments with little information is also part of the minimalist interior design philosophy. Upgrades have also been made to Mercedes-MBUX Benz's "Hey Mercedes" voice assistant, enabling even more natural pronunciation. One of the vehicle's Energising Comfort programmes, which massage the seat, play uplifting music, and emit relaxing odours into the cabin, can be enabled if someone reports feeling weary.
            There are three options to pick from two types of diesel, one petrol, and the most recent six-cylinder engine line up from Mercedes-Benz. All models of the S 500 petrol can reach 155 mph, and the 48v mild hybrid assistance helps to increase torque. 
            Unsurprisingly, the S-Class prioritises comfort. It has air suspension, which automatically lowers at high speeds while providing a plush ride for passengers. There are two variants of rear-wheel steering, one of which allows the rears to turn up to 10 degrees. According to Mercedes, an S-Class and an A-Class have similar turning circles thanks to four-wheel steering. The E-Active Body Control technology, another cutting-edge option, enables the new S-Class to lean into curves like a Pendolino train. When sensors predict a side impact, the system also elevates the ride height by 8 cm, placing the chassis such that the door sills, rather than the doors themselves, bear the brunt of the force.
            There are two six-cylinder diesels and one mild hybrid petrol engine options. There isn't a plug-in hybrid version of the S-Class yet, but that model is expected to debut later in 2021. If you prefer an all-electric vehicle, though, there is another model available: the EQS. the S 500. It is a mild hybrid with 520Nm of torque and 435 horsepower. It also has an additional 23 horsepower available on demand via its EQ mild-hybrid system, which provides a little extra power when needed. Additionally, the engine is silent while in the "coasting" mode, which turns the engine off when the vehicle is being driven softly. The 0-62 mph sprint time for both the normal and long wheelbase variants is the same at 4.9 seconds, while the top speed is again restricted to 155 mph. On the road, it accelerates effortlessly, although it isn't as smooth as we'd imagined it would be. With frequent gear changes at low speeds, the drivetrain performs optimally. The Sport Plus drive option is intended to give it a sportier feel, but it goes against the nature of the car and disrupts the flow. But there are currently two diesel versions, one petrol model, an electric plug-in and V8 variants to come, but no plug-in hybrids as of yet.
            It's a big car, but it's smart; its nimble handling belies its girth; Excellent brakes and steering. The four available drive modes are Eco, Comfort, Sport, and Sport Plus. You may also change the steering and the responsiveness of the accelerator pedal. The S-Class is the most comfortable of the bunch for daily driving, which fits with its laid-back demeanour. The S-Class performs at its best on highways. It's the undisputed big daddy version, and when overtaking, its mere existence clears the outside lane. It enables incredible speed, incredible precision around obstacles, and flawless arcs over flowing bends.
            You may feel comfortable driving this automobile to its boundaries in an emergency because all of the controls are responsive. The nine-speed automatic transmission is smooth and slurs its gear changes imperceptibly, but if you do decide to take manual control, shifting through the gears is easy enough to do using the steering wheel paddle controls. However, given the abundance of gears available, this is probably not necessary.
            The Mercedes-Benz S-Class, which has already seen its predecessor win back-to-back luxury car category awards, once again sets the standard in the luxury segment. The new model has even more technology, provides more comfort, and has improved driving performance and efficiency.
            amazing handling accuracy, Plug-in excels at comfort and elegance, and its battery lasts 60 miles. Price range: new: £83,440 - £211,460 Price range (used) £56,570 - £166,860 Energy Efficiency 19.9 - 403.6 mpg with up to 47 Miles per pound, Insurance group 50, £510-£520 for road tax. Once you get used to the technology within, it just works, and the poise, ride, and handling are quite amazing. However, there's more to it than that because it has the power to stir your emotions as well.

                  <p class="card-text"> Since its introduction in 1973, the Volkswagen Passat moniker has become just as ingrained in the family car market as the more compact Golf and Polo. It appeals to purchasers wanting for a little bit more quality and badge appeal than its mainstream competitors, just like those automobiles do. Volkswagen currently appears to be the only company that has successfully navigated the border between mass-market and premium products. The Passat appears to be your only choice if you're looking for a little upscale saloon that can compete with the premium players but has more standard equipment and space for your money.
                    One of the main factors that would make you choose the Passat over its most immediate competitors is its interior. It serves as a lesson in how to design a roomy interior that is expertly constructed, elegant, and ergonomically put out. Everything is in its proper place, the design is clear and simple to use, and the doors close with a satisfyingly strong thud. The inside, however, can differ dramatically between models, with some having smaller infotainment screens and conventional analogue controls with an ageing screen snuggled between them, while others have a feature-rich 9.2-inch display that better demonstrates VW's most recent media system. It feels like serious rivalry for more expensive rivals when combined with the company's digital dials. It would feel stale without it. overall, notably in terms of physical area, The Passat's rear legroom is impressive, and the front seats adjust to a good degree, providing lots of space. The Skoda Superb offers the same equipment, which is the main problem for the Passat.
                    The Passat offers a wide range of engines, including gasoline, diesel, and plug-in hybrid models. There are four power outputs available in the Passat, ranging in output from 120 horsepower to 240 horsepower. The most significant of them is a 2.0-liter TDI Evo engine with 150 horsepower that was introduced in 2019 as part of the range of modifications. TSI engines of 150 hp to 272 hp are available for those who prefer gasoline, albeit the top-of-the-line engine is only offered on R-Line Edition cars, a small batch of models that are as fully equipped as possible.
                    The last vehicle in the line up is a plug-in hybrid GTE that has recently made a comeback. Due to updated emissions restrictions, the vehicle was initially introduced but was later taken off the market.

                  <p class="card-text">  With the range improvements made in 2019, however, the vehicle was returned with a new battery and a greater electric driving range of approximately 34 miles. Therefore, there is a respectable selection of petrol, diesel, and plug-in hybrid (PHEV) variants to choose from, providing greater options than nearly all of its competitors for those who want a Passat. Plug-in hybrids have a long battery life. a sophisticated exterior and first-rate interior. a wide selection of engines and trims are available, it’s a less expensive substitute for a 3 Series, A4, C, or S-Class. Used monthly cost from £163, Fuel Economy 35.8 - 256.8 mpg with up to 30 Miles per pound, Road tax cost £0 - £510, Insurance group from12 - 29. New price £22,030 - £41,695. Used price £6,545 - £33,685.
                    It's a heart vs head decision. The Passat is a more reliable option to its mainstream competitors, but we're not convinced you'll love it. It has a sophisticated design, a high-quality, user-friendly interior, plenty of interior space, and a wealth of technology. It also meets a variety of purposes because a large selection of excellent engines are readily available. Can we, however, highly suggest it? Having stated that, the GTE is worthy of endorsement for business customers, but there is also a Superb variant called the iV due to minimal CO2 emissions, and the long electric driving range makes it incredibly quiet and effective in urban areas. We would advise you to choose one of the 2.0-liter TDI engines because they are effective and powerful if you don't want a plug-in hybrid. R-Line variants might feel a touch fidgety over bumpy areas, so keep things reasonable with SEL spec and you'll get a Passat that's also comfortable.
